- For unethically hacking identity, privacy and security of all my electronic devices leveraging ET tools like crowdstrike, SS7 hacking into my phone and wifi, stealing reusuable saved passwords on work laptop and abusing any technology possible such as "security and privacy" lockdown setting on mac os, session/jwt tokens, slack administrator access abuse, sending spies around my home, etc while keeping me super busy to take any precautions. I HOPE ANYONE INVOLVED IN THIS DIE FOR THAT MFers!

- For destroying culture of Compass. Its a racially bias cult now.

- For asking Jim B to fire people. Because you are a coward and a false veteran who couldn't do it himself and doesn't want to get your or any of your cult's hands dirty with the sins of wrongdoings!
- For hastily suing Zillow without any concrete plan for properly checkmating them to win the game.
